#The files should be run in the following order: 
#1. If you have the raw dataset the file make_dataset.py should be run first. This can be done from the command line or by running the function in the script. The arguments are the input and output directory paths for the data. 
#2. Run the train_model.py file in order to train a 3-layered CNN model on your processed dataset. In this case the arguments are the learning rate and the path for the processed data. This can be done either in the script or from the command line. 
#3. In order to test the model on the test data you should run predict_model.py. In this case you need to provide the path for the pretrained model weights and the filepath for the processed test data. 
#4. Lastly in visialize.py, TSNE is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space of the training data, after it has been processed by three of the convolutional layers in the model. The resulting embedded space is then visualized. Here the function arguments are the paths for the pretrained model and processed train data.
